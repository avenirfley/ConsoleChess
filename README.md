How to Make Changes

Then record the changes:

$ git commit -m "Description of changes"
NOTE: The project is setup to run a linter before accepting commits. This means your code must contain no errors and use proper syntax. This project follows the Airbnb style guide.

Finally, upload your changes to the github repository.
